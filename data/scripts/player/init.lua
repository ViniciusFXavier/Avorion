-- This is always the first script that is executed for a logged in player
-- Offline players don't have running scripts

-- Note: This script does not get attached to the Player
-- Note: This script is called BEFORE any other scripts are initialized
-- Note: When loading from Database, other scripts attached to the Player are available through Player():hasScript() etc.
-- Note: When adding scripts to the player from here with addScript() or addScriptOnce(),
--       the added scripts will NOT get initialized immediately,
--       their initialization order is not defined,
--       parameters passed in addition to the script name will be IGNORED and NOT passed to the script's initialize() function,
--       and the script will instead be treated as if loaded from database, with the _restoring variable set in its initialize() function
-- Note: Player scripts are initialized once the player's sector was loaded and the player is placed inside, not on log-in.
